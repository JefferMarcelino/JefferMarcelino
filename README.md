# Jeffer Marcelino Sunde

### About Me
Hey there! I'm Jeffer, a passionate software engineer with a focus on frontend, backend, android, ios, devops, artificial intelligence, data science, and QA. Jokes, I don't know all this stuff ðŸ˜†

### Web Development
Currently, I'm dedicated to becoming an expert in web development. I'm actively learning a lot of concepts and architectural patterns to enhance my skills in this domain.

### Interested in
I really like building things, that's why I have other skills outside my expertise, things like Android using Kotlin or React Native, Cybersecurity, and a little bit about Artificial Intelligence.

### Writing, Community, and Podcasting
Aside from coding, I'm passionate about sharing my knowledge and experiences with others. Through my articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@jeffermarcelino), I aim to provide thought-provoking insights on a wide range of topics. I'm also part of the [Maputo Frontenders](https://www.linkedin.com/company/maputo-frontenders) team, where we organize meetups, workshops, and coding events to foster growth and collaboration within our frontend development community. Furthermore, as one of the hosts on the [Debugando na Estrada](https://biolink.website/debugandonaestrada) podcast, I engage in fascinating discussions about software engineering and related subjects.
