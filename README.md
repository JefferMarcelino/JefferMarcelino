# Jeffer Marcelino Sunde

### About Me
Hey there! I'm Jeffer, a passionate software engineer with a focus on web development, Android, and artificial intelligence. I'm driven by my love for technology and continuously strive to expand my knowledge and skills in these areas.

### Web Development and Frontend Expertise
Currently, I'm dedicated to becoming an expert in frontend development. I'm actively learning advanced concepts and architectural patterns to enhance my skills in this domain. I believe that staying up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices is crucial in delivering high-quality web applications.

### Android App Development
In addition to frontend development, I'm also exploring the exciting realm of Android app development. I'm diving into [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), a modern programming language, and utilizing [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) to create beautiful and interactive UIs.

### Writing, Community, and Podcasting
Aside from coding, I'm passionate about sharing my knowledge and experiences with others. Through my articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@jeffermarcelino), I aim to provide thought-provoking insights on a wide range of topics. I'm also part of the [Maputo Frontenders](https://www.linkedin.com/company/maputo-frontenders) team, where we organize meetups, workshops, and coding events to foster growth and collaboration within our frontend development community. Furthermore, as one of the hosts on the [Debugando na Estrada](https://biolink.website/debugandonaestrada) podcast, I engage in fascinating discussions about debugging and related subjects, providing valuable insights to our listeners.

Let's build awesome things together!
