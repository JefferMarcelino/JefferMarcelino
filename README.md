Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m <strong>Jeffer Marcelino</strong>, a <strong>teenage programmer</strong>, I started programming a year ago learning <strong>Python</strong>, currently <strong>learning Web Development</strong> and I intend to become a professional in the area. I have a few projects but nothing in particular, and would like to <strong>colaborate on some projects!</strong>

About me ðŸ˜„ I really love anime, social media, and learn a lot about programming. And Iâ€™m really <strong>cool!!!</strong>
