# Jeffer Marcelino Sunde

Hey, I'm a software engineer passionate about Web Development, Android, and Artificial Intelligence. Right now, I'm focused on becoming an expert in Frontend Development, learning advanced concepts and architectural patterns to enhance my skills. I'm also diving into Android app development using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

But that's not all! I'm also a writer, sharing my knowledge and experiences through articles on Medium. You can find my thought-provoking pieces [here](https://medium.com/@jeffermarcelino), covering a wide range of topics.

By the way, I'm really proud to be part of the [Maputo Frontenders](https://www.linkedin.com/company/maputo-frontenders) team. We're a group of folks who love frontend development and we work together to make our community in Maputo even better. We organize meetups, workshops, and fun coding events where everyone can learn and grow. It's an awesome team to be a part of!

Let's build awesome things together!
